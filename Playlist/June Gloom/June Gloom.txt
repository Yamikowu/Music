lyrics:

[Verse 1]
June gloom, tule fog
I might as well say, "Meet me in Montauk"
Cold beach, you walk
I feel my body scream when you talk
She's cool, I heard
Won't act surprised, I saw the pictures
We're a house fire, for sure
Hope it'll burn out, but it just gets bigger

[Pre-Chorus]
If she's so amazing
Why are you on this side of town?
If you like her so much
What are you here tryna find out? (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Does she get this wet for you, baby?
Talk to you in poems and songs, huh, baby?
Little kiss make your head go hazy?
Is it really love if it's not this crazy?
Does she move like this for you, darlin'?
Toyin' with me now, you know when I want it
I don't lie, you're the best, iconic
I know that I haven't, but I hope you top it

[Verse 2]
How come you're just so much better? Is this gonna end ever?
I guess I'll fuck around and find out (Guess I'll fuck around)
I know I act like it's whatever, just makes me feel better
The truth is, honey, you're all I think about

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm so over you
Why would I die to feel this alive? (Oh)
Text you my favorite songs
Turning you on from the 405 (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Does she get this wet for you, baby?
Talk to you in poems and songs, huh, baby?
Little kiss make your head go hazy?
Is it really love if it's not this crazy? (Crazy)
Does she move like this for you, darlin'?
Toyin' with me now, you know when I want it (Mm)
I don't lie, you're the best, iconic (Mm-mm)
I know that I haven't, but I hope you top it

[Bridge]
Goddamn, fallin' to the kitchen floor
Goddamn, think we'd been here before
Goddamn, this could be a problem
This could be a problem, goddamn
Goddamn, I said, "Remember last night?"
You said, "Can't forget if I tried"
Goddamn, always been a problem
Always been a problem

[Instrumental Outro]
