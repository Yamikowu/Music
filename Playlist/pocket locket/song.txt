[Intro]
One day he will be mine

[Verse 1]
I'm your type, I'm the vibe
Fantasize, stay the night
Every night, I can keep all your secrets in my pocket locket
And then I keep ya held down when I lock and drop it
Yeah, you be sly, that's alright
I don't mind, you be cruel
I'll survive, playing that hard to get love showing no affection
I know it's hard to keep up with my good intentions

[Pre-Chorus]
You must think I'm mad to need ya
They must think I'll never leave ya
I don't see my love as weakness
I know in the end you'll be the one, one, one

[Chorus]
Right now I bet you think you've got me in the palm of your hand
Give me no love, you get that good love, hope that you don't regret
Taking so long to see that I'm the best thing you'll ever have
Come get that love, boy, get that good love, baby, while you still can

[Verse 2]
I'm the shit, I'm a trip
Take a sip, watch it drip
From your lip, know that I can keep you held down with my little finger
And I would do it all day just to let you linger
You know that I would take the time
To let you ride, let you try to do me right
Hoping that you're learning real quick asking all the questions
'Cause if you push me too far you gone learn your lesson

[Pre-Chorus]
You must think I'm mad to need ya
They must think I'll never leave ya
I don't see my love as weakness
I know in the end you'll be the one, one, one

[Chorus]
Right now I bet you think you've got me in the palm of your hand
Give me no love, you get that good love, hope that you don't regret
Taking so long to see that I'm the best thing you'll ever have
Come get that love, boy, get that good love, baby, while you still can

[Outro]
Oh baby, while you still can
That love, boy, get that good love
While you still can, oh, yeah
Come get that love, boy, get that good love
While you still can
