lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wish you knew
But I disguise the truth
I say I'm happy but I'm still stuck on us, mm-mm-mm
Does your mind play this game too?
Think 'bout me and you
I guess I'll just pretend until it all makes sense, hm-mm-hm, hmm-hmm

[Pre-Chorus]
See you face to face, I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be
But I can't make a scene, but I can't make a scene
See you face to face, I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be
But I can't make a scene, but I can't make it seem

[Chorus]
Like I want you
You, ooh, ooh
Even if it's true, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Even if it's true

[Verse 2]
I guess it's overdue
Tell me your point of view
Tell me, am I to blame?
You're so good with change, hm-hm-mm
A table set for two
You got me waitin' but you ain't comin' through
Try to stay patient but gotta face the truth, mm-mm-mm
Oh, woah-woah

[Pre-Chorus]
See you face to face (See you face to face), I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be (Thinking 'bout the days)
But I can't make a scene (No, I can't make a scene), but I can't make a scene (No, no, no, no, oh)
See you face to face (See you face), I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be (Oh-oh)
But I can't make a scene (No, no-no, no-no), but I can't make it seem

[Chorus]
Like I want you
You, ooh, ooh
Even if it's true, ooh (Even if it's true)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (You, babe)
Even if it's true

[Bridge]
There's no reason to believe I'll save us now
But if you really love me, say it now
Why is it so hard to figure out?
I need you every day, believe me when I say it

[Chorus]
Like I want you
You, ooh, ooh
Even if it's true, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Even if it's true
