lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sexy to someone is all I really want
Sometimes sexy to someone is all I really want
Nothin' more, nothin' less, I've thought, walkin' through the park
Sexy to someone, I think about it all
Checkin' out of the hotel or moments at a bar
Ask if I'm in a movie, no, I didn't get the part

[Chorus]
Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without

[Verse 2]
Sexy is something I see in everything
Honey stickin' to your hands, sugar on the rim
Nothing more, nothing less, I've thought, take it all to heart
I want afterglowing, and when I call a car
Send me eyes with the knowing that I could pull it off
Ask if I'm doing TV, no, I didn't get the job

[Chorus]
Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without

[Bridge]
I want to be sexy to someone (Is it too much to ask?)
I want to be sexy to someone (Then what's holding you back?)
I want to be sexy to someone (It's not too much to ask)
Sexy to someone

[Chorus]
Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without
Sexy to somebody, it would help me out
Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house
And it's just a little thing I can't live without
