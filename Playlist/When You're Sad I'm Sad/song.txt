lyrics:

[Verse 1]
It's the last, it's the last time
Oh, that's what I keep sayin' about us
In the past, put you back there
I tried movin' on, but you never budge

[Pre-Chorus]
So I never get to give my love
To someone who actually deserves it all
'Cause I turn around and you're there sayin'
"Please don't go"

[Chorus]
So I take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
Baby, don't do that 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Wonder why you're callin' me so late
When you know I'm gonna worry
I can hear, hear the tears in your eyes
When you say, "Please come and get me"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I never get to give my love
To someone who actually deserves it all
'Cause I turn around and you're there sayin'
"Please don't go"

[Chorus]
So I take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad (Yeah)
Baby, don't do that 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad

[Bridge]
Oh
You don't understand a goodbye
'Cause it's been over for a long time
You know how to make me fall for you
Just like that (Baby, just like that)
Baby, just like that (Baby, just like that)
Baby, just like that
Ooh

[Verse 3]
It's the last, it's the last time
Oh, that's what I keep sayin' about us
In the past, put you back there
I try movin' on, but I just give up

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I'll never get to give my love
To someone who actually deserves it all
'Cause I turn around and you're there sayin'
"Please don't go"
[Chorus]
So I take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
Baby, don't do that 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
'Cause you know that you're the best I ever had
Yeah, I'll take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
