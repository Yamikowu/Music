lyrics:

[Verse 1]
He's got a cross on his neck, but he spends Sundays in my bed
He's my blue jean little baby, with a halo on his head
He's got lips like cherry wine, and cigarette smoke on his breath
He's got pretty long brown hair, green eyes that look like sex

[Pre-Chorus]
Knees down at your altar
Please don't fail me now

[Chorus]
You know all my secrets
American Jesus, baby
Won't you take me to Heaven tonight?
You know you're my weakness
American Jesus, save me
You'rе the greatest lovе of my life
American Jesus

[Verse 2]
Let's drive off into the sunset, baby we can be reborn
Walk on water in the desert, make a saint out of a whore

[Pre-Chorus]
Knees down at your altar
My cowboy in the crown

[Chorus]
You know all my secrets
American Jesus, baby
Won't you take me to Heaven tonight? (Tonight)
You know you're my weakness
American Jesus, save me
You're the greatest love of my life (My life)
American Jesus

[Post-Chorus]
You got me red, white, and blue
Pledging my allegiance to you
Tell me you believe in me too, "I do"
Ooh, seein' the stars in your eyes
No, I've never felt so alive
We can ride 'til we die

[Chorus]
You know all my secrets
American Jesus, baby
Won't you take me to Heaven tonight? (Tonight)
You know you're my weakness
American Jesus, save me
You're the greatest love of my life (My life)
American Jesus

[Post-Chorus]
You got me red, white, and blue
Pledging my allegiance to you
Tell me you believe in me too, "I do"
Ooh, seein' the stars in your eyes
No, I've never felt so alive
We can ride 'til we die

[Outro]
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
My American Jesus
