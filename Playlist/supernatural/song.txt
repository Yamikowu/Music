lyrics:

[Intro]
(This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all)
(It's taking over me, don't wanna fight the fall)

[Verse 1]
Don't want nobody else around me
Just need you right here
You're like the only thing that I see
It's crystal-clear, and I

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to come claim it, I do
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, I want you to name it, I do
Want you to make it yours

[Chorus]
It's like supernatural
This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's takin' over me, don't wanna fight the fall
It's like supernatural
(This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all) Mm
It's like supernatural (Oh)
(This love's possessin' me, but I don't mind at all) Mm
