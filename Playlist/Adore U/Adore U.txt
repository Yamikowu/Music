lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Started on two different pages, I'm happy we made it
You say that you're broken, I'm the one who saves you
Thousand miles apart and God knows that I hate it
Nothing hurts me more than when we're separated

[Pre-Chorus]
Thousand miles apart and you're still in my heart
Can we take it back? I'm waiting at the start
Fly me to the moon and now I'm seeing stars
When we touch, hmm
Feels like

[Chorus]
High, we should just smoke
We should get high, we should just
(Fall into my arms, let me adore you)
High, we should just float
If you can fly, we should just
(Fall into my arms, let mе adore you)

[Verse 2]
I see that look in your eyes
I'll do whatеver you like
Sit back and I'll fantasize
Feels like I'm falling for you
I know you don't open up (Up)
I wanna fight for your trust (Your trust)
Why don't we focus on us?
Baby, I'd die for your love
[Pre-Chorus]
Thousand miles apart and you're still in my heart (You're still in my heart)
Can we take it back? I'm waiting at the start (Waiting at the start)
Fly me to the moon and now I'm seeing stars (Oh)
When we touch (Touch, touch)
(Feels) Feels like

[Chorus]
High, we should just smoke
We should get high, we should just
(Fall into my arms, let me adore you)
High, we should just float
If you can fly, we should just (Yeah, feels like)
(Fall into my arms, let me adore you)
High, we should just smoke (Oh)
We should get high, we should just (Yeah)
(Fall into my arms, let me adore you)
High, we should just float
(Do you trust in me like I do?)
If you can fly, we should just
(Do you trust in me like I do?)

[Bridge]
(Know I do) Adore you
(Do you trust in me like I do?)
Just can't help myself (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Fly)
(Yeah, oh)
[Chorus]
High, we should just smoke
We should get high, we should just (Yeah, oh)
(Fall into my arms, let me adore you)
High, we should just float
If you can fly, we should just

[Outro]
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
