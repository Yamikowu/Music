lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Seventeen, I can't recall a thing
A cry for help, but no one's ever listenin'
My life moved faster than the speed of sound
Wish I could go there now and slow down

[Verse 2]
Ain't it strange, how people tend to change?
I hope she knows that I would never blame her
'Cause all she did was all she knew (Aah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, is it too late now to slow down?

[Chorus]
All my life, I've never had the chance
To stop and smell the flowers (Flowers)
All this time, I never got to sit
And dream away the hours
No memories like black and white TV
And everybody says it'll be okay
Like life is just a game
But I don't wanna play

[Verse 3]
Twenty-one, it should've been so fun
Cherry ripe, I wish I had more time
This summer skin, it fades too quick somehow (Aah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, is it too late now to slow down?

[Chorus]
All my life, I've never had the chance
To stop and smell the flowers (Flowers)
All this time, I never got to sit
And dream away the hours
No memories, like black and white TV
And everybody says it'll be okay
Like life is just a game
But I don't wanna play

[Outro]
Ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna
