lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's me, or maybe it's you
Maybe I never learned my lesson
Someone to seek, someone to soothe
Someone to answer all your questions

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what to tell ya
Maybe I never knew
Not tryna make you jealous
But it looks so good on you
Been stuck on elevators
In airports and empty rooms
Been stuck here, waiting for you

[Chorus]
For cryin' out loud
I'm calling your name
You're wearing me out
But I love you the same
For cryin' out loud
Your heart is a maze
You're running your mouth
But I'm singing your praises

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
All of your clothes all over the floor
All of it happened in a hurry
Show me the ropes, then you show me the door
Why don't you show me why you're so worried?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sweating off your makeup
You're running every light
What's gonna help you wake up
Won't help you sleep at night
Sometimes I see the future
Sometimes I'm not so bright
Sometimes you're looking for a fight

[Chorus]
For cryin' out loud (Loud)
I'm calling your name (Name)
You're wearing me out (Out)
But I love you the same
For cryin' out loud (Loud)
Your heart is a maze (Maze)
You're running your mouth (Mouth)
But I'm singing your praises

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
For cryin' out loud (Loud)
I'm calling your name (Calling your name)
You're wearing me out (You're wearing me out)
But I love you the same (I love you the same)
For cryin' out loud (Loud)
Your heart is a maze (Your heart is a maze)
You're running your mouth (Mouth)
But I'm singing your praises

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Watch what you say when you're talking to me
The meaner you are, the harder to leave
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Walking away with your kiss on my cheek
And a bruise underneath
For cryin' out loud
