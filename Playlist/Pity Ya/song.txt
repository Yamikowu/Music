[Intro]
Ohhh ohhh
Yeah nooo
Come on
Uhmm aye

[Verse 1]
I'll always be there for you, you know it too
From the bottom of my heart but you got me fooled
You say that I'm the one who put you through it all
You play the game better than I took you for

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you're free you get on with the first chick you could hit
Now you act like you ain't desperate to put me through shit
No, I never saw that coming for that I'ma give you some tip
Pity you for your fit, I'ma give you some tips, don't commit, no
Maybe this time I'm better alone
I need no text, no calls on the phone
No one to do me wrong

[Chorus]
I'ma give you some tip
Maybе just don't commit
I'ma give you some tip
Maybe just don't commit
Pity you for your fit
Pity you for your shit
I'ma givе you some tip
Maybe just don't commit
Don't commit no

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me it's my fault, it's your call
You played your game too well
Don't be hitting my phone, you're on your own
I'm better alone

[Pre-Chorus]
So now you're free you get on with the first chick you could hit
Now you act like you ain't desperate to put me through shit
No, I never saw that coming for that I'ma give you some tip
Pity you for your fit, I'ma give you some tips, don't commit, no
Maybe this time I'm better alone
I need no text, no calls on the phone
No one to do me wrong

[Chorus]
I'ma give you some tip
Maybe just don't commit
I'ma give you some tip
Maybe just don't commit
Pity you for your fit
Pity you for your shit
I'ma give you some tip
Maybe just don't commit
Don't commit no
[Bridge]
This time I'll leave before I get numb
I'll be the girl you wished you held on
Feeling are better gone

[Chorus]
I'ma give you some tip
Maybe just don't commit
I'ma give you some tip
Maybe just don't commit
Pity you for your fit
Pity you for your shit
I'ma give you some tip
Maybe just don't commit
Don't commit no
