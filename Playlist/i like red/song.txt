lyrics:

I like red you like green
I'm team Marvel and you're DC...

Stop making it obvious
It's getting monotonous
How did we get lost in this
Our differences, oh

I gotta be honest
We're making excuses
Don't wanna settle
Might be better on my own

I like red you like green
I'm team Marvel and you're DC
In my head we ain't meant to be
I like you so the jokes on me

I like red you like green
I'm team Marvel and you'rе DC
In my head we ain't meant to bе
I like you so the jokes on me (on me)

Don't like the smell of your cologne
I'd rather be alone but, oh
Keep hitting me up on my phone
'Cause baby I don't mind (mhmm)
Gimme a sign
It's gonna take a while
Just wanna intertwine but never mind

​don’t wanna grow up
Charlene Su
Last Christmas
Wham!
Take it slow for a minute
Now I caught this flow gonna kill it
Just think about it

Think about it anyway
Think about it anyway

You and me not the same
Some things never change
Drivin' me insane
Uh let's call the whole thing off

I like red you like green
I'm team Marvel and you're DC
In my head we ain't meant to be
I like you so the jokes on me

I like red you like green
I'm team Marvel and you're DC
In my head we ain't meant to be
I like you so the jokes on me (it's on me)

Don't know if you see
You ain't ready for me
I don't know if you see
You ain't ready, my baby
