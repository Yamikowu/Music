lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I'm somebody you call when you're alone
I'm somebody you use, but never own
I'm somebody you touch, but never hold
And you're somebody I'll never really know
I know I'm not the one you really love
I guess that's why I've never given up
'Cause I could give you all you want
The stars and the sun, but still, I'm not enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all I really wanted was that look in your eyes
Like you already know that I'm the love of your life
Like you already know you're nеver saying goodbye

[Chorus]
But I'm not yours
I'm not yours, I'm not yours
I want more
I want morе, but I'm not yours
And I can't change your mind
But you're still mine

[Verse 2]
So tell me that it's time for me to go
'Cause you know I can't do it on my own
The only thing that's harder than sleepin' alone
Is sleepin' with your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all I really wanted was that look in your eyes
Like you already know that I'm the love of your life
Like you already know you're never saying goodbye

[Chorus]
But I'm not yours
I'm not yours, I'm not yours
I want more
I want more, but I'm not yours
And I can't change your mind

[Bridge]
I should've known that it was dumb love
Fifteen dozen roses
All the things that I've done
For you not to notice
Can't believe I chose you
Over all my best friends
What the fuck did I do
In the end?
Just to not be yours
