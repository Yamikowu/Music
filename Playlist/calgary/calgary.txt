lyrics:

[Intro]
Yeah, mm

[Verse 1]
Same bar, same street
I'm twenty, but I still feel like fifteen, oh-oh
Same fears, same dreams
Still tryna get my brother to like me, mmm
You said that I always seem to land on my feet
But I got problems hangin' like a chain 'round my neck
Tryin', but I'm barely seein' past twenty-three
And the best of me, right now, is lookin' a lot like a mess

[Chorus]
I thought I had my shit together
Can't lie, the pills are lookin' temptin', oh-oh
I thought that I was gettin' better
No, I got better at pretendin', oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
Ah
Ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Old friends, downtown
They didn't like me then and don't like me now
I'm drunk, oh, wow
All my habits came back around
"I'll figure it out," that's what I say
Figure it out and take a break
I'll figure it out, maybe one day

[Chorus]
I'll finally get my shit together
Can't lie, the pills are lookin' temptin', oh-oh
I thought that I was gettin' better
No, I got better at pretendin', oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
Ah
Ah-ah
Ah
Ah-ah

[Bridge]
And I do it again, I'm a creature of habit
The moment's gone, but I'm still tryna catch it
Everyone left and I never got past it
Never got past it

[Outro]
Same bar, same street
I'm twenty but I still feel like fifteen
