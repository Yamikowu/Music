lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Wake up (Wake up)
Just to see your face (Just to see your face)
Stay up (Stay up)
With you everyday (With you everyday)
Got to (Got to, got to)
Find a better way (Find a better way)
To tell you (Tell you, tell you)
Before I run away (Before I run away, ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus]
Maybe, I may never find the words to say
Wait another lifetime so that I could stay
I know that you've always been in love with me
But I know that you've also had to watch me leave

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, I'll love you anyway, ooh

[Verse 2]
I said it
"I'm in love with you" ("I'm in love with you")
But I can't (I can't)
Tell you what to do (Tell you what to do)
And, oh my god
What a waste of breath
Wanna live with me and replace the rest
So I won't ever breakdown

[Chorus]
Maybe, I may never find the words to say
Wait another lifetime so that I could stay
I know that you've always been in love with me
But I know that you've also had to watch me leave

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, I'll love you anyway, ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway, ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway, ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway, ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway, ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway, ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway, ooh
